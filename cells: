Cell is the fundamental unit of life: it is the basic building unit of living organism:
eg: take an example of home where we are having that is build of brick by brick so here in gome brick is the example cells because it is the fundamental unit of complete home:

cell was discovered by the scientist name as robert hook:
and the cell he discoverd that time was dead cells:
all planst and animal are made of cells:
and all cells regenerate itself and produce the new one:


classification of organism based on number of cells:
1)unicell and multicell:

1)UNICELLULAR: THOSE who are made up of single cell is known as unicellular eg:bacteria ameoba, paramecium:

2)multicellular:those who are made up of two or more cells are known as multicellular:
eg: plants and animal

diffrent shape of cell:
smooth muscle: spindle shaped 
RBC:biconcave:
sperm:
egg: spherical:


**smallest living cell= mycoplasma:
**largest living cell= ostrich egg:

structural component of cell:
cell is made up of various componenet:
1)cell wall: rigit outside covering the plasma membrane of plant cell:
2)plasma membrane : outermost covering of cell:
3)cytoplasm: fluid isnide plasma membrane:
4)Nucleus: control center of cell
5)cell oragenslls: perfoem specific operation:


1)cell wall: it is presnt is plant not in animal:
it is made up of cellulose:
protect from physcial damage: it is rigit 

2)plasma membrane: it is living covering of cell:
it is flexible and living, it is made up of lipids and protiens:
it is also called selectively permeable mebrane: beacuse it allows enetry and exit of certain selective materials through it:

Diffusion: spontaneous movement of material solid liquid or gases  from region of high concentrauon to low concentraion region i known as diffusion:
CO2 and O2 move in plasma membrane throigh diffusion:

osmosis: here the substance move from high to low concentraion through spm:
it is special case of diffusion:
1)the substance is water or solvent:
2)passing through semi permeable mebrane:
eg: abosorption of water in plant through its roots:

endocyteis: cell take food and substance from enviornment:
exocytosis: expells the food to outside enviornment:
occurs in ameoba:

protoplasm: inside cell content is knwn as protoplasm:

Nucleaus:
control center of the cell:
double mebrance called the nuclear envelope:
nuclear membrane has pores allow movement of substance into cytoplasm:
contains genetic material DNA:


DNA(de oxy ribonucleac acid): it basically consist of imfomation about our character:
thread like structure presnt inside nucleus:
contain info about our char:
inherit genetic info from one genration to other:

Gene: it is special segment of DNA that contain info about the hair colour, size an shape of node and many more:
chromosome consit of dna+ protien:

Endoplasmic reticulam:it is large net of membrane bound tubes and shets:
helps in trransport of material between cytoplasm and nucleus: protiens and lipids:
rough endoplasmic reticulam: here ribosomes is attached: non rough endoplasmic reticulam: here no ribosemes
is attached:

Ribosomes
Ribosomes are small, dense, spherical organelles present in all living cells. They are known
as the protein factories of the cell because their main function is to synthesize proteins by translating genetic information from mRNA.

Structure
Ribosomes are made of rRNA (ribosomal RNA) and proteins.
They have two subunits:
Large subunit
Small subunit
In eukaryotic cells: 80S ribosomes (60S + 40S)
In prokaryotic cells: 70S ribosomes (50S + 30S)
S = Svedberg unit (sedimentation rate during centrifugation)

Location
Free in the cytoplasm
Attached to rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER)
Inside mitochondria and chloroplasts (have their own ribosomes)

Functions
Protein synthesis (translation)
Free ribosomes make proteins used inside the cell
Bound ribosomes (on RER) make proteins for:

Cell membrane
Secretion outside the cell
Lysosomes
Importance
Essential for growth and repair
Presence of ribosomes is a key feature of all living cells

**Lysosomes
Lysosomes are membrane-bound cell organelles found in eukaryotic cells, especially animal cells.
They are known as the “suicidal bags of the cell” because they contain powerful digestive enzymes that 
can break down harmful substances and even the cell itself if needed.

Structure
Single-membrane bound organelles
Contain hydrolytic enzymes (digestive enzymes like proteases, lipases, nucleases, etc.)
Work best in acidic pH

Functions
Digestion of unwanted materials
Break down worn-out cell organelles (autophagy)
Destroy foreign particles like bacteria (defense)
Cell digestion if damaged (autolysis — leads to cell self-destruction)
Helps in intracellular digestion
Helps in recycling cellular components

Location
Present in animal cells
Rare or absent in plant cells (plants usually use vacuoles for digestion)

Why Called Suicidal Bags?
Because when lysosomes burst, enzymes leak into the cytoplasm and digest the cell.

Key Points to Remember
Formed by Golgi apparatus
Contain hydrolytic enzymes
pH inside lysosome is acidic
Important in cell defense and waste removal

Mitochondria
Mitochondria are double-membrane cell organelles found in eukaryotic cells and are known as the “powerhouse of the cell”
because they produce energy in the form of ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate).

Structure
Double membrane:
Outer membrane: smooth
Inner membrane: folded into structures called cristae
Cristae increase surface area for energy production
Matrix: inner fluid-filled space containing enzymes, DNA, ribosomes
Possess circular DNA and 70S ribosomes (like bacteria)

Functions
Energy production through cellular respiration
Convert glucose and oxygen into ATP
Heat production in some cells
Regulate cell metabolism
Play role in apoptosis (programmed cell death)

Special Features
Semi-autonomous organelle (can replicate on its own)
Inherited maternal DNA (passed from mother to offspring)
Cells needing more energy (e.g., muscle cells, sperm tail) contain more mitochondria

| Feature        | Description                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Nickname       | Powerhouse of the cell         |
| Membrane       | Double membrane                |
| Inner membrane | Cristae                        |
| Contains       | DNA, ribosomes, enzymes        |
| Function       | ATP production via respiration |
| Found in       | Eukaryotic cells               |

Plastids
Plastids are large, membrane-bound organelles found mainly in plant cells and algae. 
They are important for photosynthesis, storage, and pigment synthesis. Plastids are absent in animal cells.

types:
| Type             | Function                           | Example / Pigment                                              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chloroplasts** | Photosynthesis                     | Contain **chlorophyll** (green pigment)                        |
| **Chromoplasts** | Provide colour to fruits & flowers | Contain pigments like **carotene, xanthophyll**                |
| **Leucoplasts**  | Storage of food                    | Amyloplast (starch), Elaioplast (fat), Proteinoplast (protein) |

✅ Structure
Double-membrane organelle
Inside fluid called stroma
Have thylakoids stacked into grana (in chloroplasts)
Contain :
DNA
Ribosomes (70S)
Enzymes
Because of their own DNA & ribosomes, plastids can replicate independently → hence called semi-autonomous organelles

✅ Functions
Photosynthesis (in chloroplasts)
Storage of food (starch, fat, protein)
Give colour to flowers and fruits
Synthesis of important organic molecules
