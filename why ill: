🌿 Essential Conditions for Good Health
Balanced Diet
– Provides all necessary nutrients, vitamins, and minerals in correct proportion.
– Helps the body grow, repair, and stay energetic.
Clean Environment
– Pollution-free surroundings and clean water reduce risk of diseases.
– Proper sanitation and waste disposal are important.
Personal Hygiene
– Regular bathing, brushing, washing hands, and wearing clean clothes prevent infections.
Proper Rest and Exercise
– Physical activity keeps the body fit, and rest/sleep helps recovery and relaxation.

🦠 Means of Spread of Infectious Diseases:
🔹 1. Air-borne Transmission
Spread through tiny droplets released during coughing, sneezing, or talking.
Examples: Common cold, Tuberculosis, Measles, COVID-19.
Prevention: Cover mouth/nose, proper ventilation, mask use.

🔹 2. Water-borne Transmission
Spread through contaminated water containing pathogens.
Examples: Cholera, Typhoid, Hepatitis A.
Prevention: Drink boiled or purified water, maintain sanitation

🔹 3. Food-borne Transmission
Spread through contaminated or undercooked food.
Examples: Food poisoning, Amoebiasis.
Prevention: Eat fresh, properly cooked food, wash hands before eating..

🔹 4. Vector-borne Transmission
Vectors are organisms (usually insects) that carry pathogens from one host to another.
Examples:
Female Anopheles mosquito → Malaria
Aedes mosquito → Dengue
Culex mosquito → Elephantiasis
Prevention: Mosquito control, insect repellents, nets.

🔹 5. Direct Contact Transmission
Spread by touching, kissing, sexual contact, or contact with wounds/fluids of infected person.
Examples: AIDS, Ringworm, Chickenpox.
Prevention: Avoid direct contact, maintain hygiene, use protection.

🔹 6. Indirect Contact Transmission
Spread through contaminated objects (towels, utensils, needles).
Examples: Cold, Tetanus.
Prevention: Don’t share personal items, sterilize medical tools.

💊 Antibiotics
🔹 Definition:
Antibiotics are chemical substances that kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria and are used to treat bacterial infections.
They are not effective against viruses, fungi, or parasites.

🔹 Discovery:
Alexander Fleming (1928) discovered Penicillin from Penicillium mold.
This was the first widely used antibiotic.

**Types of antibiotics:
| **Type**           | **Action**                                           | **Examples**                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Bactericidal**   | **Kill bacteria directly**                           | Penicillin, Streptomycin      |
| **Bacteriostatic** | **Stop bacterial growth** (immune system kills them) | Tetracycline, Chloramphenicol |

**Mechanism of actions:
🔹 Mechanism of Action:
Antibiotics act by targeting bacterial cell structures or functions that are absent in human cells:
Cell wall synthesis inhibition → Penicillin, Cephalosporin
Protein synthesis inhibition → Tetracycline, Streptomycin
DNA/RNA synthesis inhibition → Ciprofloxacin, Rifampicin
Metabolic pathway inhibition → Sulfonamides

🔹 Examples of Common Antibiotics:
Penicillin – throat infections, wound infections
Streptomycin – TB treatment
Tetracycline – skin and respiratory infections
Ciprofloxacin – urinary tract infections

Preventing diseases is better than curing them. Prevention reduces suffering, medical costs, and the spread of infections.
🔹 Main Principles:
Maintain Personal Hygiene
Keep body, hands, teeth, and nails clean.
Wash hands before eating and after using the toilet.
Safe Drinking Water & Clean Food
Drink boiled or filtered water.
Eat fresh and properly cooked food.
Avoid contaminated food and water.
Proper Sanitation & Waste Disposal
Dispose of garbage and sewage properly.
Keep surroundings clean to prevent vectors like mosquitoes and flies.
Control of Vectors (Insects & Animals)
Use mosquito nets, insect repellents, and sprays.
Control rodent and fly population to prevent disease spread.
Vaccination / Immunization

**************************************************White Blood cells*********************************
⚪ White Blood Cells (WBCs)
🔹 Definition:
White Blood Cells, also called leukocytes, are colorless, nucleated cells in the blood that protect the body against infections and foreign substances.
🔹 Key Features:
Produced in: Bone marrow (primary site)
Present in: Blood and lymph
Normal count: 4000 – 11000 per microliter of blood
Life span: Few days to years depending on type
Function: Immunity and defense against pathogens
Protects against many infectious diseases (e.g., Polio, Measles, TB, Hepatitis).
Boosts immunity in children and adults.
Healthy Lifestyle
Eat balanced diet, exercise regularly, and get adequate sleep.
Avoid alcohol, smoking, and junk food.
Early Diagnosis & Treatment
Detect diseases early for timely treatment.
Prevents complications and reduces spread.

✅ In short:
Prevention of diseases includes hygiene, sanitation, vaccination, vector control, safe food & water, and a healthy lifestyle — these principles protect both individuals and communities.

*****WBC are classifeid in two groups:******************
1️⃣ Granulocytes (Granular WBCs)
Have visible granules in the cytoplasm.

Short life span (few days).
| **Type**        | **Percentage** | **Function**                                                           | **Examples / Notes**                                |
| --------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Neutrophils** | 60–70%         | First line of defense; **phagocytosis of bacteria**                    | Multi-lobed nucleus; respond to bacterial infection |
| **Eosinophils** | 2–4%           | **Fight parasites** and involved in **allergic reactions**             | Granules stain red with eosin                       |
| **Basophils**   | 0.5–1%         | Release **histamine & heparin**; cause inflammation & prevent clotting | Granules stain blue; rare in blood                  |

2️⃣ Agranulocytes (Non-Granular WBCs)
No visible granules, larger life span.
| **Type**        | **Percentage** | **Function**                                                                    | **Examples / Notes**                           |
| --------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Lymphocytes** | 20–30%         | Produce **antibodies** (**B-cells**) & **cell-mediated immunity** (**T-cells**) | Important for long-term immunity               |
| **Monocytes**   | 3–8%           | **Phagocytosis**, present antigens to lymphocytes                               | Largest WBC; become **macrophages** in tissues |

🔹 Functions of WBCs (Summary)
Phagocytosis: Engulf and destroy microbes (Neutrophils & Monocytes)
Antibody production: Lymphocytes produce antibodies against pathogens
Allergic response: Eosinophils & Basophils
Inflammation & healing: Basophils release histamine; Monocytes clean damaged tissues
Immunity maintenance: Protect the body from infection

✅ In short:
WBCs are the body’s defense cells. Granulocytes (Neutrophils, Eosinophils, Basophils) handle immediate defense.
while Agranulocytes (Lymphocytes, Monocytes) provide long-term and adaptive immunity.
