Diversity refers to the presence of differences among people, organisms, or things. In simple terms, it means variety — differences in characteristics, traits, or forms within a group or environment.
In biology, diversity (or biodiversity) means the variety of living organisms found in a particular region or on the entire Earth.
It includes differences among plants, animals, microorganisms, and the ecosystems they form.

**In Biology:
Biological diversity (Biodiversity) can be seen at three main levels:
1)Genetic Diversity – Variation of genes within a species.
Example: Different varieties of rice or mangoes.

2)Species Diversity – Variety of species within a region.
Example: A forest having tigers, elephants, deer, and birds.

3)Ecosystem Diversity – Variety of ecosystems in an area.
Example: Deserts, forests, rivers, and mountains.

🌿 What is Classification?
Classification in biology is the process of grouping living organisms into categories based on their similarities and differences.
It helps scientists organize, identify, and study the vast diversity of life on Earth in a systematic way.

🎯 Need for Classification
There are millions of living organisms on Earth — plants, animals, and microorganisms.
Without classification, studying each organism separately would be impossible.
Hence, classification helps to:
1)Identify and name organisms easily.
2)Understand relationships between different organisms.
3)Study evolution and how life forms are related.

🧠 Basis of Classification
Organisms are classified based on several characteristics such as:
Cell structure – prokaryotic (without nucleus) or eukaryotic (with nucleus).
Body organization – unicellular or multicellular.
Mode of nutrition – autotrophic (make own food) or heterotrophic (depend on others).
Reproduction – asexual or sexual.
Body design and complexity – simple or complex body structures.

| **Level**   | **Description**           | **Example (Human)** |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Kingdom** | Largest group             | Animalia            |
| **Phylum**  | Group of related classes  | Chordata            |
| **Class**   | Group of related orders   | Mammalia            |
| **Order**   | Group of related families | Primates            |
| **Family**  | Group of related genera   | Hominidae           |
| **Genus**   | Group of related species  | Homo                |
| **Species** | Smallest, specific group  | Homo sapiens        |

Trick to remember:
👉 King Philip Came Over For Good Soup
(Kingdom → Phylum → Class → Order → Family → Genus → Species)

🌍Five Kingdom Classification (R.H. Whittaker, 1969)
Whittaker proposed a system dividing all organisms into five kingdoms:

| **Kingdom**  | **Examples**               | **Key Features**                          |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Monera**   | Bacteria, blue-green algae | Unicellular, prokaryotic                  |
| **Protista** | Amoeba, Paramecium         | Unicellular, eukaryotic                   |
| **Fungi**    | Yeast, Mushroom            | Multicellular, heterotrophic, decomposers |
| **Plantae**  | Algae, Ferns, Trees        | Multicellular, autotrophic                |
| **Animalia** | Humans, Dogs, Fish         | Multicellular, heterotrophic, mobile      |

🧬 Binomial System of Classification (Binomial Nomenclature)
🌟 Introduction
The Binomial System of Classification, also called Binomial Nomenclature, is a method of naming living organisms scientifically using two names.
It was introduced by Carolus Linnaeus in the 18th century.

📘 Meaning
“Bi” means two and “nomial” means names.
So, every organism is given two names:
Genus name
Species name
Example:
👉 Homo sapiens — scientific name of humans
Homo → Genus
sapiens → Species

🔬 Rules of Binomial Nomenclature (set by ICZN – International Code of Zoological Nomenclature)
Each name has two parts – Genus and Species.
Genus name starts with a capital letter.
Species name starts with a small letter.
The name should be written in italics (when printed) or underlined separately (when handwritten).
Example: Panthera leo (printed) or Panthera leo (handwritten)
The names are usually in Latin (a universal language for scientists).
Each species has a unique name all over the world.

Eg: of binomial 
| **Common Name** | **Scientific Name**  |
| --------------- | -------------------- |
| Human           | *Homo sapiens*       |
| Mango           | *Mangifera indica*   |
| Tiger           | *Panthera tigris*    |
| Housefly        | *Musca domestica*    |
| Neem            | *Azadirachta indica* |
| Rice            | *Oryza sativa*       |
