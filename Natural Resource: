1. What are Natural Resources?
Definition:
Natural resources are materials or substances that occur naturally in the environment and are useful to humans.
Examples:
Air, Water, Soil
Forests, Minerals, Coal, Oil
Sunlight, Wind, Plants, Animals
Characteristics:
Occur naturally.
Can be renewable or non-renewable.
Used for human survival and development.

**Types of natural resource:
| Type                        | Examples                                  | Notes                                              |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Renewable Resources**     | Solar energy, Wind energy, Water, Forests | Can be replenished naturally within a short period |
| **Non-renewable Resources** | Coal, Petroleum, Natural Gas, Minerals    | Limited in supply, take millions of years to form  |

3. Importance of Natural Resources
Provide raw materials for industries.
Source of energy.
Maintain ecological balance.
Support biodiversity.
Human survival depends on air, water, food, and shelter.

| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Renewable Resources**     | Solar energy, Wind energy, Water, Forests, Animals, Plants                          | - Solar: Electricity, heating <br> - Wind: Electricity <br> - Water: Drinking, irrigation, hydroelectricity <br> - Forests: Timber, oxygen, habitat <br> - Animals/Plants: Food, medicine, raw material | - Planting more trees (Afforestation) <br> - Using water efficiently <br> - Protecting wildlife <br> - Using renewable energy sources wisely |
| **Non-Renewable Resources** | Coal, Petroleum, Natural Gas, Minerals (iron, copper, gold), Nuclear fuel (Uranium) | - Coal: Electricity, industries <br> - Petroleum: Fuel, chemicals <br> - Natural Gas: Fuel, heating, electricity <br> - Minerals: Construction, machinery, electronics <br> - Nuclear fuel: Electricity | - Reduce wastage <br> - Recycling (for metals) <br> - Using alternatives where possible <br> - Sustainable mining practices                  |


**Human impact on natural resources:
| **Activity**         | **Resource Affected**  | **Impact**                                          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Deforestation        | Forests                | Loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, climate change  |
| Overuse of water     | Water                  | Scarcity, lowered water table, reduced aquatic life |
| Mining/Industries    | Minerals, fossil fuels | Land degradation, pollution, habitat loss           |
| Pollution            | Air, Water, Soil       | Health hazards, acid rain, contamination            |
| Overhunting/Poaching | Wildlife               | Endangered species, loss of biodiversity            |
| Urbanization         | Land, Water, Energy    | Soil sealing, resource pressure, waste problems     |
