life process is the basic and  essential process of life that is basic or bare minimum need of human body to be performed is known as life process:
:
it sclasit of 4 parts:
1)nutrition: the process of obtaining and utilising the food is known as nutrition:
2)respiration: the process of taking oxygen and perform the rrspiration:
3)trasnportation: the transfer of substance from one part of body to another is transportaion:
4)excretion: the process of removal of waste from the body is excretion:

**Nutrition:
it is of two type:
1) autotrophic: those who made there food by themselves are autotrophic: eg: plant and autotrophic bacteria:
2) hetrotrophiC: those who can not make there food by tehm selve are hetrotrophic eg: for this is man, cat, leech and all:

** hetrotrophic can be divided into 3 more parts:
1)Holozoic: here organism consume and internally digest the organic substance: eg: man, cat, paramecium
2)saprophytic:organism feed on dead and decaying material like fungi on breads yeast and so all:
3)parasitic: here they take and eat from diffrent part of human body is parasitic : eg: leech and so all:

1) Photosynthese: it is the process in which plant make there own food in presence of sunlight water chloropgyl and all so this process is known as photosynthesis:
condition neccesry for photosyntheses:
i) cholorophyll:
ii) carbon di oxide:
iii)water:
iv)sunlight:

CO2 + H20 ===C6H12O6 + H2O + O2 HERE IN PLACE OF === UPER SIDE OF THIS IS CHLORPHYLL AND ALL:
 HERE C6H12O6 IS GLUCOSE AND ALL:

process:
absorption of light energy by chlorophyll:
 conversion of light nergy into chemical energy and then splitting of water molecule in hydrogen and water:
reduction of carbon di oxide to carbohydrate:

site of photosyntheseis is chloroplast it is cell presnt inside plant where this photosynthesis occurs:
chlorophyll is present inside the green coloured organesls called chloroplast
* the leves are greaan because of chlorplast:

Co2 enters through stomata:
stomata is the tiny pores that present on the surface of leaves:
water it is taken by the roots from the soil:
nitrogen and all these taken in the form of nitrates:
in plants food(Glucose) is stored in the form of starch:
in animal it is stored in the form glycogen:


hetrtrophes:
AMeoba nutrition:

** nutrition in human beings:
alimentry canal= it is the longest tube from mouth to anus:
teeth: crushing or cut the food or eating material inside mouth: there are 32 teeth incisor canines molars and premolars:
Liver: secretes bile juice which is stored in gall bladder, it make acidic food coming from stomach alkaline:
emuslofication of fats: it break down fats into smaller globules:
pancreas: secrte pancreatic juice. there are two typeof pancreatic juice: trypsin : digest proties and lipase: breaking down of emulsified proties:
small intestine: here the coiled form inside body is small intestine her complete absorption of food and all takes place:
villi: lot of fingerlike projection are present inside small intestine increase surface area of absorption:
salivary glands: it secrets saliva and saliva contans anzymes = salivary amylaze which breaks down starch to simple sugar here then tounge mixex it with and help in swaloowing
osophegus: contraction and expansion pushes food isnide stomach from mouth: it is known as food pipe:
gastric glands: HCL: create acidic medium for enzyme pepsin. kills bacteria and germs:
pepsin: protien digesting enzymes:
mucus: prevent inner linning of stomach from acid:
large intestine:here it absorb large ammount of unabsorbed food:
Anus: here exist of waste material via anus is regulated via anus sphinctor:


**Respiration: the process of breaking down of food and relaese energy in the form of ATP is known as respiration:

Respiratry system in human:
Nostrils: air enter the passage here:
Nassal passage: have hair linning passage for filtration of air passge lined with mucuc to trap the dust and give filter hair:
pharynx: common passage for food and oxygen:
Larynx: sound box produce sound and consist of vocal chords allow air to pass into the trachesa:
Alveoli:alveloi are tiny air like ballons located at the end of bronchiles. thin walled and mist for easy gas diffusion sorrounded by a network of blood capilaries: each lung contain millions of allevloi:
rings of cartlage: prevent air passage from collapsing.
trachea: windpipe:
bronchi: two brochi connects trachea to each lungs
bronchiles: each bronchi divides in lung to form large number of small tubes called bronchiles. bronchiles are larger air passage tube that lead directly to alevoli:
Alevloi:  they are rich supplied with blood vessels for diffrent exchange of gases( oxygen and carbon di oxide) oxygen from allevoili diffuse into the blood capilaries carbon di oxide from blood diffuses into allevoli:

*Diaphagram: it seprates the heart from the abdomen;
residual volume: amount of air alwasy living in the lung is residual volume:

**Respiration in plants:
here in day time: photosynthesis oxygen is produced:
respiration: carbon di oxide is produced:
and so net oxygen is produced:

in night time: corbon di oxide is produced:

**Breathing in fish:
 here fish take water in mouth force it past the gill and dissolved oxygen is taken by blood:

** terrostrial organism: they breath oxygen in atmoshphere: and rate of breathing is less:
** aquatic organism: they use the dissolved oxygen in water. rate of breathing is more as they have to obtain the oxygen dissloved in water.

*** TRANSPORTAION: the process of transfer of foods and oxygen and other things from one part of body to anther is knwon as transportation:
transportation in human : is of two types:
1)Circulatry system:
2)Lymphatic system:

1) Circulatry system: it consist of heart, blood, blood vessels.

**BLOOD:
it is red coloured body fluid that circulates throughout body and carries essential substance to the cells and removing the waste product:
Blood components:
1)Plasma: Fluid medium, transport food, carbon di oxide and nitogenous waste:
2)RBCS: red blood cells:contain hemoglobin and transport oxygen: hemoglobin: a protien found in RBC binds with oxygen transport oxygen and CO2 and give red colour to blood:
3)WBCS: white blood cells: here it fight infections. produce antibody to kill pathogens: provide immunity:
4)platelts: stops blood by clotting blood:

Blood vessels: here blood pipe that flow through whole body:

**Heart: a muscular organ roughly the size of fist that acts as pump to circulate the body through the body:
The heart is a muscular organ about the size of your fist.
It acts as a pump that continuously circulates blood throughout the body, supplying oxygen and nutrients and removing carbon dioxide and wastes.

It lies slightly tilted to the left side of the chest, protected by the rib cage.

** Strcuture of hearts:
| **Side**       | **Upper Chamber (Atria)**                                                 | **Lower Chamber (Ventricles)**                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Right side** | **Right atrium** – receives **deoxygenated blood** from body (via veins). | **Right ventricle** – pumps deoxygenated blood to **lungs**.   |
| **Left side**  | **Left atrium** – receives **oxygenated blood** from lungs.               | **Left ventricle** – pumps oxygenated blood to **whole body**. |

** valves in heart:
| **Valve name**              | **Location**                                 | **Function**                               |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Tricuspid valve**         | Between right atrium and right ventricle     | Prevents backflow of blood to right atrium |
| **Pulmonary valve**         | Between right ventricle and pulmonary artery | Prevents backflow from artery to ventricle |
| **Bicuspid (mitral) valve** | Between left atrium and left ventricle       | Prevents backflow to left atrium           |
| **Aortic valve**            | Between left ventricle and aorta             | Prevents backflow from aorta to ventricle  |

blood connected with heart:
| **Vessel**                          | **Carries**        | **To/From**                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| **Vena cava (superior & inferior)** | Deoxygenated blood | From body → Right atrium    |
| **Pulmonary artery**                | Deoxygenated blood | Right ventricle → Lungs     |
| **Pulmonary veins**                 | Oxygenated blood   | Lungs → Left atrium         |
| **Aorta**                           | Oxygenated blood   | Left ventricle → Whole body |

🔄 4. Circulation of Blood (Double Circulation)

Human beings have double circulation, meaning blood passes through the heart twice in one complete cycle.

(a) Pulmonary Circulation

Right ventricle → Pulmonary artery → Lungs → Pulmonary veins → Left atrium
👉 Carries deoxygenated blood to lungs and brings back oxygenated blood.

(b) Systemic Circulation

Left ventricle → Aorta → Body → Vena cava → Right atrium
👉 Carries oxygenated blood to body and brings back deoxygenated blood.

💓 5. Working of the Heart (Heartbeat Process)

Blood enters the right atrium from the body (via vena cava).

It moves into the right ventricle.

Right ventricle pumps it to the lungs for oxygenation (via pulmonary artery).

Oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium (via pulmonary veins).

It moves to the left ventricle, which then pumps blood to the entire body through the aorta.

Each heartbeat = one complete contraction and relaxation of the heart.

| **Disease**         | **Description**                                           |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Heart attack**    | Blockage of blood flow to heart muscles (lack of oxygen). |
| **Hypertension**    | High blood pressure, makes the heart work harder.         |
| **Atherosclerosis** | Fat deposits narrow the arteries.                         |
| **Arrhythmia**      | Irregular heartbeat.                                      |

**About of LYMPH***
1)Lymph is a colorless fluid (slightly yellowish) found in the body.

2)It is formed from tissue fluid that leaks out of blood capillaries.

3)It carries white blood cells (lymphocytes) — helps in fighting infections.

4)It helps in transport of fats and fat-soluble vitamins from the intestine.

5)It returns excess tissue fluid back into the bloodstream.

6)It flows through lymph vessels and lymph nodes.

7)Lymph nodes filter germs and dead cells — part of the immune system.

*****Transportation in plants:****

slow transportaion sysem 1)plant do not move 2)have large propetion of dead cells in many tissue hence they have low energy needs and low transportaion system:
XYLEM and PHLOEM:

| **Feature**                 | **Xylem**                                                                | **Phloem**                                                         |

***Excreation in HUMAN BEINGS:
removal of waste from bodi is excretion:
the excretry system includes:
1)idney:nitorgen waste such as urea and acid are filtered:
2)Apair of ureter: connects the kidneys with uranry bladder:
3) uranry bladder: here the urine is stored :
4) Urethra : transport urine out of body:

**Nephrons: the strcutural and functionol unit of kidney is nephrons: each kidney has millions of nephrons:

8)Lymph moves slowly (no pump like heart), pushed by body movements
