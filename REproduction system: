REproduction is process in which the new orgainsm of same type is produced and help in continuty of species in earth and i create helps in variation of DNA that heps living being survive here on earth:

Life process: it is process by which a living being is able to survive the life:
so here reproduction is not life process:

**DNA= deoxy robonucliec acid: here DNA is the blueprint of the life:

Chromatin: it is scattered form of DNA: 
chromosmes: it is highly condened and coiled form of DNA:

when reporduction happen the DNA create its blueprint of it but due to some diffrece of cells inside it the same and exact thing didnt get formed AND THATS WHY SAME THING DIDNT GET FORMED AND THERE HAPPEN SOME DIFFRENCE :

** HERE ARE FEW STEPS:
 reproduction involve formation of new cells

formation of new DNA copying:
 error during DNA copying:
 variation during DNA sequence and information:
 New characters gets formed:

so overall this was the process for this:

variation: it heps us all the speices to survive like there are rose  so diff form are rose there like red rose white rose pink and so on so this is the variatio of same species and help in organim to live life in this changing enviornment:

** how do organism reproduce:

1) Assexual Reproduction:
i)single parent
ii) no genmate
iii)no fertlisation
iv) off spring formed and genetically similar:

2)sexual reproduction: here two parents are involved male and female:
and vereything is opposote of assexual reproducution:

**Types of asexual reproduction:
1)Binary fission: here the cell is divided into two parts:
 eg: bacteria, ameoba, paramecium:
 here parent cell is divided into two equal parts and both the equal parts get into new organism and so on:

Ameba: here ameoba consist of nucleus and cytoplasm inside it so here nucleus is something that consist of information of genes and so on: and cytoplasm is jelly like substance that fills it:
 here nucleus gets divided into two halsves and the two daughter cells get formed:

** when nucleus here gets divided into parts then that process is known as kerio kynasis:
** and when cytoplasm get divide here into two parts then this is known as cytokinesis:

* another example: LESMANIA= IT IS AN PROTOZOA DUE TO WHICH WE FEEL ONE DESESE KNOWN AS KALA AZAR:
 here in this case there is logitudnal fisson occur:

** Budding: it is process in which there is bud grows on upper part and letter then that bud gets grown and sepratde from that bud organism and so on: and letter gets seprtaed with cytoplasm and so on:
**Budding in hydea: here one hydra grows in sorrounding and latter that hydra gets out or explode oout from hydra:

** Fragmentaion in spirogrya: here they get fragmented unti diff parts and then at last all that parts gets grown seprtaely:
** regenration in planeria: here all the parts get regenarted this is in planiaia:

**Vehetative propogation: it is type of asexual reproduction in which plant reproduce itself with the help of its vegetative parts:
1)stem(potatao, onion, and lemon) 2) root( sweet potato guvava) 3) leaves( BRYOPHYLUM):
