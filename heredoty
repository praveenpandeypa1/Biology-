Heredity: Heredity is the passing of traits (characters) from parents to offspring through genes.

**Basic terms you must know:
| Term                | Meaning                                                                                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Trait**           | Any **characteristic** that can be inherited (e.g., eye color, height, etc.)                            |
| **Gene**            | A **unit of heredity** made of DNA that controls a specific trait                                       |
| **Allele**          | Different forms of a gene (e.g., Tall (T) and short (t) for height)                                     |
| **Genotype**        | Genetic makeup of an organism (e.g., TT, Tt, tt)                                                        |
| **Phenotype**       | Physical appearance (e.g., Tall or Short)                                                               |
| **Dominant Trait**  | The trait that is **expressed even in one copy** (e.g., T in Tt)                                        |
| **Recessive Trait** | The trait that is **masked by dominant one**, expressed only when both alleles are recessive (e.g., tt) |
| **Homozygous**      | Both alleles are same (TT or tt)                                                                        |

**Mandels experiment: fathet of genetics:
🧠 Who was Mendel?
Gregor Johann Mendel (1822–1884) was an Austrian monk and scientist.
He is known as the Father of Genetics.
He performed experiments on pea plants (Pisum sativum) for 7 years (1856–1863) in the garden of his monastery.

  **Why mandels choose pea plants:
| Reason                              | Explanation                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1. Short life cycle                 | Many generations could be studied quickly |
| 2. Clear contrasting traits         | e.g. Tall/short, Round/wrinkled seeds     |
| 3. Self-pollinating                 | Natural self-pollination ensures purity   |
| 4. Can be cross-pollinated manually | Allowed control of breeding               |
| 5. Easy to cultivate                | Grows easily and produces many seeds      |

  **Traits studied by mandels:

| Character          | Dominant Trait | Recessive Trait |
| ------------------ | -------------- | --------------- |
| 1. Plant height    | Tall           | Dwarf           |
| 2. Flower color    | Violet         | White           |
| 3. Flower position | Axial          | Terminal        |
| 4. Pod color       | Green          | Yellow          |
| 5. Pod shape       | Inflated       | Constricted     |
| 6. Seed shape      | Round          | Wrinkled        |
| 7. Seed color      | Yellow         | Green           |

  🧬 Mendel’s Experimental Steps
1️⃣ Monohybrid Cross (One trait)
Example: Crossing tall and dwarf pea plants
Parent Generation (P):
Tall (TT) × Dwarf (tt)
Gametes: T and t
F₁ Generation:
All plants Tall (Tt)
→ Only dominant trait appears (Tall).
Self-pollination of F₁:
F₁ (Tt) × F₁ (Tt)
F₂ Generation (offspring):
Genotypic ratio: 1 TT : 2 Tt : 1 tt
Phenotypic ratio: 3 Tall : 1 Dwarf
🧩 Conclusion: One trait (Tall) dominates over the other (Dwarf).

2️⃣ Dihybrid Cross (Two traits)
Example:
Round Yellow (RRYY) × Wrinkled Green (rryy)
F₁ Generation:
All Round Yellow (RrYy)
Self-pollination of F₁:
(RrYy × RrYy)
F₂ Generation:
Phenotypic ratio:
9 Round Yellow : 3 Round Green : 3 Wrinkled Yellow : 1 Wrinkled Green
🧩 Conclusion: Traits are inherited independently (Law of Independent Assortment).

  ***Mandells three law of inheritance:
| Law                                  | Explanation                                                                                                            | Example                                    |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Law of Dominance**              | One factor (gene) dominates the other; the dominant trait appears in F₁.                                               | Tall (T) is dominant over Dwarf (t).       |
| **2. Law of Segregation**            | Each trait is controlled by two factors (alleles) which separate during gamete formation; only one enters each gamete. | TT → gametes have T and T; tt → t and t.   |
| **3. Law of Independent Assortment** | Genes for different traits are inherited independently of each other.                                                  | Seed color and shape behave independently. |

🧬 1. Chromosomes
📖 Definition:
Chromosomes are thread-like structures made of DNA and proteins (histones) present inside the nucleus of every cell.
They carry hereditary information from parents to offspring.

🧫 2. Genes
📖 Definition:
A gene is a segment of DNA on a chromosome that controls a specific trait or character.
Each gene acts as a blueprint for making a particular protein that determines a characteristic (like eye color, blood type, etc.).

🧬 What is DNA?
Full form: Deoxyribonucleic Acid
Definition:
DNA is a long, double-stranded molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning, and reproduction of all living organisms.
It is often called the “Blueprint of Life.”

| **3. Control of cell activities** | DNA directs cell growth, repair, and metabolism.    |
| **4. Mutation**                   | Small changes in DNA cause variation and evolution. |

🧬 DNA and Genes Relationship
Gene = A small section of DNA that carries instructions to make a specific protein.
Many genes together form a chromosome.
👉 DNA → Gene → Protein → Trait

🌱 Variation — Definition
Variation means the differences in characters or traits among the individuals of the same species.
➡️ In simple terms, no two individuals (except identical twins) look exactly the same — these small or large differences are called variations.

🧬 Cause of Variation
Variations arise mainly due to:
1)Genetic causes (inherited variation):
During sexual reproduction, genes are shuffled when gametes (sperm and egg) combine.
Crossing over during meiosis leads to new gene combinations.
Mutations (sudden changes in DNA) also cause variation.

2)Environmental causes (acquired variation):
Due to changes in environment, food, climate, or lifestyle.
Example: a person becomes strong by exercising — not inherited to the next generation.

**Types of variation:
| Type                         | Description                                    | Example                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Inherited (Genetic)**      | Passed from parents to offspring through genes | Eye color, hair type, blood group        |
| **Acquired (Environmental)** | Develops during lifetime, not passed on        | Learning to play guitar, tanning of skin |
| **Continuous**               | Small differences that blend gradually         | Height, weight                           |
| **Discontinuous**            | Clear-cut differences                          | Blood group (A, B, AB, O)                |

Eg:
🧠 Examples
In a population of bacteria, few may survive when antibiotics are added — due to variation, those with resistance survive and reproduce.
Some plants tolerate drought better — variation helps them live in dry regions.
