here i will talk about control and cordination in detail:

stimulus: when we wake up and get outside and suddenlt the sunlight come towrd our eyes and we close it then this is known as stimus means change in your sorrounding:
Response: here whatever we change and give the response to sorrounding is known as response we give response to stimulus:
control cordination: here diff parts of body work together and give together the reponse to stimulus so it is known as cordination:

** cordination in animal is from two parts:
1) Nervous system:   2) Endocrine system:

1)Nervous system: it is of two type:
i)CNS  and ii) PNS

here CNS(Central nervous system) it is divided into two parts: Brain and Spinal Chords:
and Peripheral nervous system it is divided into two parts: Cranial Nervers and spinal Nerves:

**  Spinal chord is not the backbone:

** Receptors: diffrent parts of body like cells tissu and organ that recive stimulus is known as receptors:

Receptor                sense organ              stimuli
photo recepror           eyes                     light
olfactry receptor         nose                    smell
gaustatry receptor        tounge                  taste
phone receptor            sound                   ear
thermo receptor           skin                    heat and temprature
Nociceptor                skin                    pain

**Nerve : A nerve is the bundle of fibre that carries signal between diffrent part of body and brain enabling sensation and movement and othe nody function:
Neuron:
i)it  is structural and functionl unit of nervous syetm
ii)longest cell in the body:
iii)carry message in the form of electrical impulse and signal:
 dendrites: it collects information:
 Axon: electrical impulse travel along axon:
Mylean sheath:prevents leaking out of signals from axons:
cell body : it takes the information from the dendrites in form electrical signal:
nerve ending: electrical impulse cause relaese of signal:

**Synapse:
i)Microscopic gap between two nuerons:
ii)the role of synapse is to transfer the electric impulse from one neuron to another. at a synapse the electrical impulse cause the relaese of chemical from the nerve dening of one neuron. these chemicals cross the synaptic gap and reaches dendrites tip
  of next neuron generating a new electrical signal in that neuron:

** transmission of impulse between two neurons:
chemical collected at the end of dendritic tip:
chemical reaction create the movement of ions:
ions movement creates potential
electrical impulse generated at dendrtic tip
impulse travel from dendrites to cell body
impulse travel through axons:
reaches nerve ending
release of chemical at nerve ending:

** Types of neurons:
1) sensory neuron: transmit impulse from Receptors to CNS:
2)Motor neuron: trnasmit impulse from CNS to effectors:
3)Relay neurons:connects sensory and motor neurons:

**Neuromuscular junction:point of contact between nerve ending of motor neurin and a muscle:
musclels cells have specilised protien that change their shape ans size in response to nervous electrical impulse:
muscles cells move by changing there shape  so that they shorten:

***Actions in body: there are 2 types of action: 
1) Voluntry action: controlled by will, thinking and brain involved, eg: walking , dancing, writing etc
2)invluntry actions: not controlled by will: thinking not involve will, eg: blood pumping and all:

Reflex action: it is the action that body produce on the spot and protect our body it is done via spinal chord:

***Brain: it is the contro system of body are you can say it as prime minister:
brain has three main parts:
1) forebarain:
it is main thinking part of brain
consist mainly of cereblum and hypothalmus
hearing memeory speech and all
emotion interpretaion
all voluntry action:

2)Mid brain:
connects forebrain and hind brain
control some involuntry action:

3)Hind- brain:
pons: regulate breathing and sleeping cycle:
modula: control involuntry action like   blood pressure heart attack salivation and vomiting:
cerebellum:precison of voluntry action, mainting posture and balance of body:(picking a pencil and riding a bike)

Hypothalmus: it basically controls the hunger, thurst and control secretion of harmones from endocrine system:
***** Forebrain is the largest part of brain:

**Protection of brain:
1)Cranium= part of skull:
2)3 thin membranes=minenges
3)CSF= to absrob any shock cerebro spinal fluid:

** protection of spinal chords:
1)verteberal column
2)3 thin membranes known as meninges
3)CSF for absorbing the shock:


***Endocrine system: it is combination od diff diff endocrine glands that help in formation and secretion of chemical and produce harmones:
harmones: it is the chemical that act as massenger and carries information:

  ** 6 important points to remember:
Pituitary gland is called the master gland because it controls other glands.

Insulin is the only hormone that lowers blood glucose level.

Adrenaline is called the emergency hormone.

Thyroxine requires iodine for its production.

Pancreas is both endocrine and exocrine in nature.

Hormones act in very small amounts but have powerful effects.

  **Cordination in plants:
Coordination means the ability of an organism to receive information from its surroundings and respond properly to it.
In plants, there is no nervous system or brain, yet they show coordination through:
Hormones (chemical coordination)
Growth movements (tropic and nastic movements)

**Types of cordination:
| Type                      | Based on                       | Example                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Chemical coordination** | Plant hormones (phytohormones) | Auxin promotes growth                           |
| **Growth movements**      | Tropic and nastic movements    | Bending towards light, closing of Mimosa leaves |

Plant harmoes: they are chemical massenger that control growth development and response to stimmuli:

**Main plant harmones:
| Hormone                    | Function                                                  | Example / Effect                                                |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Auxins**              | Promote cell elongation, root formation, and phototropism | Bending of stem towards light                                   |
| **2. Gibberellins (GA)**   | Promote stem elongation, seed germination, flowering      | “Foolish seedling” disease in rice caused by excess gibberellin |
| **3. Cytokinins**          | Promote cell division and delay aging (senescence)        | Found in young fruits and seeds                                 |
| **4. Abscisic Acid (ABA)** | Inhibits growth, causes leaf fall and dormancy            | Called **stress hormone**                                       |
| **5. Ethylene**            | Helps in fruit ripening and leaf fall                     | Used to ripen fruits artificially                               |

🧠 Remember Trick: “A Good Child Always Eats”

A – Auxin
G – Gibberellin
C – Cytokinin
A – Abscisic acid
E – Ethylene

Movements in plants is of two types:
1)1. Tropic Movements (Directional)

→ Movement towards or away from stimulus.
→ Permanent and growth-related.
  | Type              | Stimulus  | Example                                   |
| ----------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Phototropism**  | Light     | Stem bends **toward** light               |
| **Geotropism**    | Gravity   | Roots grow **downward**, stems **upward** |
| **Hydrotropism**  | Water     | Roots grow **toward** water               |
| **Thigmotropism** | Touch     | Tendrils coil around support              |
| **Chemotropism**  | Chemicals | Growth of pollen tube towards ovule       |

2)Nastic Movements:
| Type            | Stimulus    | Example                                                    |
| --------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Thigmonasty** | Touch       | Folding of *Mimosa pudica* (touch-me-not) leaves           |
| **Photonasty**  | Light       | Opening and closing of *Datura* or *Morning glory* flowers |
| **Seismonasty** | Shock       | Sudden closing of leaves after shock                       |
| **Thermonasty** | Temperature | Tulip flowers open with rise in temperature                |

**Electrical cordination in plants:
🌿 C. Electrical Coordination in Plants

Some rapid movements (like Mimosa pudica) are due to electrical signals between cells — similar to nervous signals but slower and simpler.

  **Diff in tropic and nastic movement:
| Feature   | Tropic Movement                  | Nastic Movement            |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Direction | Depends on direction of stimulus | Independent of direction   |
| Nature    | Growth movement                  | Non-growth movement        |
| Example   | Bending of stem towards light    | Folding of *Mimosa* leaves |
